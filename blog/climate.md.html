                            **Climate Change?**

Existing literature on Climate Change seems to either be politically charged
with little scientific merit, or made by and for scientists who are
happy to argue about the minutia.  Here we try to do some real science,
albeit simple science to try to come to terms with Climate Change.  Is
it happening? What is causing it?  How worried should we be?

Black Body Radiation
====================


Let's begin at the beginning.  Let's start by working out what the temperature
of the Earth should be if treated as a black body.  The sun is bathed in
radiation from the Sun, and as a warm body released radiation of its own.  Its
equilibrium temperature will be set by the temperature at which these two
fluxes cancel.  

The power radiated per unit area of a warm black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann
Law [#wiki:Stefan-Boltzmann]:

\begin{equation}
P/A = \sigma T^4
\end{equation}
where $\sigma = 5.67\times 10^{-8}\un{W/m^2/K^4}$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann
constant, $T$ is the temperature of the body, $P$ is the total power radiated
and $A$ is the area of the body.

The Sun warms the earth. Given our distance from the Sun, the solar flux
density, or \emph{solar constant} is ~\cite{wiki:solarconstant}
\begin{equation}
\Omega_\Sun = 1361\un{W/m^2}
\end{equation}
Each square meter directly facing the Sun recieves $1361\un{W}$ of power.  

The Earth is partially reflective, and will immediately reflect some fraction
of this radiation directly back into space.  The earth's average albedo
is~\cite{wiki:albedo} $\alpha = 0.3$.

Balancing these out, we can solve for the black body temperature of the Earth.
The power coming in is the non reflected solar irradiance incident on Earth's
cross sectional area ($\pi R_\Earth^2$), while the power going out is just the
total power generated by the Earth treated as a black body over its whole
surface ($4\pi R_\Earth^2$).
\begin{equation}
(1-\alpha) \Omega_\Sun (\pi R_\Earth^2) =  \sigma T_\Earth^4 (4 \pi R_\Earth^2) 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
T_\Earth^\text{(blackbody)} = \left( \frac{(1-\alpha) \Omega_\Sun}{4 \sigma} \right)^{1/4} = 255\un{K} = -19\un{^\circ C} = -1\un{^\circ F}
\end{equation}
This is much colder than the observed average temperature of earth of~\cite{noaa}:
\begin{equation}
T_\Earth^\text{(obs)} = 288\un{K} = 14.6\un{^\circ C} = 58.3\un{^\circ F}
\end{equation}
This $33\un{K}$ difference must be accounted for.

Temperature of the Sun
----------------------

We can take a second to use this to estimate the temperature of the Sun, if we
model that as a blackbody as well. 

\begin{equation}
4 \pi R_\Earth^2 \sigma T_\Earth^4 = (1-\alpha) \pi R_\Earth^2 \frac{4 \pi R_\Sun^2 \sigma T_\Sun^4}{4 \pi a_0^2}
\end{equation}
which simplifies as
\begin{equation}
T_\Sun = T_\Earth \sqrt{\frac{2 a_0}{R_\Sun}} (1-\alpha)^{-1/4} = 5780\un{K}
\end{equation}
Which agrees well with the effective photosphere temperature of the
Sun~\cite{wiki:sun} of $T_\Sun = 5772\un{K}$.

Spectrum
--------

The spectrum of a blackbody follows~\cite{wiki:planck}:
\begin{equation}
B_\lambda(\lambda,T) = \frac{2 h c^2}{\lambda^5} \frac{1}{e^{\frac{h c}{\lambda kT}} - 1}
\end{equation}


![Figure [spectrum]: The theoretical black body spectrums for the Earth (blue) and Sun (orange). 
The edges of the visible spectrum are shown as grey dashed lines.  Notice that the 
Sun's radiation is centered in the visible spectrum, while the Earth's radiation is
at much longer thermal IR wavelengths. The Sun's radiation is also much larger, here
multiplied by $10^{-6}$ go get them on similar enough scales to plot.](figures/spectrum.png)

If we plot these black body curves for both the Sun and Earth using the black
body temperatures we found above, we obtain \cref{fig:spectrum}. Notice that
the radiation from the sun is centered in the visible range, while the
radiation from the Earth is at much larger wavelengths corresponding to thermal
IR wavelengths of around $10\un{\mu m}$.

Temperature of the Moon
=======================

Instead of the Earth, we could try to predict
the temperature on the surface of the Moon,
as this should be simpler given the Moon's lack
of an atmosphere.

The only real difference with the moon is its albedo
which sources online suggests is closer to 0.1.

There is some data [here](https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/chang-e-1).

Lapse Rate
==========

There is an inherent question as to what increase in
temperature we have from the atmosphere alone
at the surface.  If I try to imagine an ideal
gas atmosphere around a planet, its clear
that the pressure would be higher near the bottom,
and so, so would the temperature.  

It would be nice if we could work out what this does for an Earth like planet.  

Perhaps the place to start is with the lapse rate.
Consider a small parcel of air as it moves
up in Earth's atmosphere.  If that process
is adaiabatic, we can figure out 
how its temperature changes.

\[ dQ = 0 = dU - P dV \]
\[ U = \frac 32  P V \]
\[ \frac 23 dU = P dV + V dP \]
\[ -\frac 52 \frac{dV}{V} = \frac 32 \frac{dP}{P} \]
\[ -P dV = \frac 35 V dP \]

\[ 0 = m C_V dT + \frac 35 V dP \]
with hydrostatic equilibrium

\[ dP = -\rho g dz \]
\[ m C_V dT = - \frac 35 m g dz \]
\[ \frac{dT}{dz} = -\frac 35 \frac{g}{C_V} = -\frac{g}{C_P} = 9.8 \un{\circ C/km} \]

Other Energy Sources
====================

It is worth taking a second to look at other potential energy sources that
could heat the earth.  Remember that the solar constant is $\Omega_\Sun =
1361\un{W/m^2}$.  Integrated over the cross sectional surface of the Earth,
this is $ P_\Sun = 173,000\un{TW} $. Compare this with total human global
energy production of~\cite{globalenergy} $P_\text{human} = 18\un{TW}$


Residence Times
===============

First let's try to calculate and tabulate some of the typical residence times
for some of the substances of interest.

Water
-----

How long does water stay in the atmosphere? What is the typical time a water molecule
will spend up there before it comes back to the ground?  Naively we might expect
that it should be roughly $\frac 1 2$ the time between major rainstorms. 
In detail, it is  given by the ratio between the total stock of 
$\ce{H2O}$ in the atmosphere and the total flux~\cite{spherical}.

$$ T_{w,\textrm{atm}} = \frac{M_{w,\textrm{atm}}}{F_{w,\textrm{atm}}} = \frac{ 1.3 \times 10^{13}]{m^3}}{ 5.18 \times 10^{14} \un{ m^3/yr}} = 0.025\un{yr} = 9.1\un{days} $$

This agrees well with our intuition, suggesting that on average across
the earth, rain happens about once every 18 days or so. 
Interestingly it also corresponds to a global average annual 
rainfall of 40\un{in}.

\newthought{Meanwhile for the oceans} we have the following:
$$ T_{w,\textrm{oc}} = \frac{M_{w,\textrm{oc}}}{F_{w,\textrm{oc}}} = \frac{1.35\times 10^{18}]{m^3}}{4.56\times 10^{14}\un{m^3/yr}} = 2960\un{yr} $$

Carbon
------

### Carbon in Biosphere

$$ T_{\textrm{terrestrial}} = \frac{\textrm{stock of land biomas}}{\textrm{{continential net primary productivity}}} = \frac{5.6 \times 10^{17}]{g(C)}}{5 \times 10^{16}\un{g(C)/yr}} = 11.2\un{yr} $$

$$ T_{\textrm{ocean}} = \frac{\textrm{stock of living marine biomass}}{\textrm{marine net primary productivity}} = \frac{2\times 10^{15}]{g(C)}}{2.5 \times 10^{16}\un{g(C)/yr}} = 0.08\un{yr} \sim 1\un{month}$$

### Carbon in Atmosphere

Natural Flows
-------------

Antropogenic
------------

Atmospheric Chemistry
=====================

As \ce{CO2} is dissolved in seawater:
$$\ce{H2O + CO2 + CO3-2 -> 2HCO3-} $$
And we know that


Simple Response
===============

Assuming a simple model of how the system will respond to the pollutant, the steady state concentration of the pollutant will be $M_p = F_p T_p$ which lets us show that \ce{CO2} is much more concerning that \ce{H2O}.

If we have some kind of pollutant

$$ \frac{d M_p}{dt} = F_{p,in} - F_{p,out} = 40 - 0.1 M_p $$

$$ \frac{dX}{dt} = a + b X $$
$$ X(t) = -\frac{a}{b} + ce^{bt}$$

Earth's Temperature
===================

Blackbody
---------

Doing some simple blackbody physics

$$ \frac{\Omega}{4} = a\frac{\Omega}{4} + \sigma T^4 $$
which gives
$$ T^4 = \frac{(1-a) \Omega}{4 \sigma} $$
which gives for earth
$$ T_0 = 255\un{K} $$
which is cold, surface temperature is closer to 290\un{K}.

Greenhouse
----------

Instead imagine the atmosphere is in layers.

$$ \Omega/4 = a \Omega/4 + \sigma T_0^4 $$

$$ 2\sigma T_0^4 = \sigma T_1^4 $$
$$ 2\sigma T_1^4 = \sigma T_0^4 + \sigma T_2^4 $$

$$ 2\sigma T_{n-1}^4 = \sigma T_{n-2}^4 + \sigma T_s^4 $$

$$ T_0 = [\Omega (1-a)/4 \sigma]^{1/4} $$
$$ T_1 = 2^{1/4} T_0 $$
$$ T_2 = 3^{1/4} T_0 $$
$$ T_s = (n+1)^{1/4} T_0 $$

In order of importance, water vapor, carbon dioxide and ozone.

Using molecular cross section data, apparently earth's atmosphere has a effective depth of $n=2$, but this would predict $T_s = 336\un{K}$, too hot.

But this ignores some effects.  Let's try to correct them, the atmosphere will have two zones, where teh boundary will contain about half of the atmospheric water, this would be 1.7\un{km} but if you count the other gases it should be 1.8\un{km}, this this height, the pressure is 80\% of sea level, so that means by weight it has 80\% of the mass above this point.

Let's correct.  About $86\un{W/m^2}$ of solar energy
are absorbed by the atmosphere, 80\% of this goes to dry air and 20\% to the water in air.  So, 
the fraction absorbed in the upper zone is 
$$ 0.8 \times 0.8 + 0.5 \times 0.2 = 74\% $$
So 26\% in the lower zone.  Round this off to 70\% and 30\%.

Next, $20\un{W/m^2}$ emitted from surface makes it through the IR window and goes straight to space.

Finally convection moves heat off the surface. This is about $17\un{W/m^2}$. The lapse rate of the troposphere, defined as the negative of the rate of change
of the temperature with increasing altitude
is about $6.5\un{K/km}$, but the model we used 
predicts a lapse rate of $30\un{K/km}$. 

Finally we need to account for the latent heat released. This can be gotten from the average annual
global precipitation rate and the average 
annual global evapotranspiration rate.  And the amount
of heat needed to vaporize water that starts
at $290\un{K}$.  The result is $80\un{W/m^2}$.

The revised equations are
$$ W + \Omega/4 = a(\Omega/4) + \sigma T_0^4 + F_w $$
$$ 2 \sigma T_0^4 = \sigma T_1^4 + 0.5 F_e + 0.7 F_s $$
$$ 2 \sigma T_1^4 = \sigma T_0^4 + \sigma T_s^4 - F_w + F_c + 0.5 F_e + 0.3 F_s + W $$

Solving these gives
$$ T_0 = 249.6\un{K} $$
$$ T_1 = 278.3\un{K} $$
$$ T_s = 289.3\un{K} $$
pretty close.

This connects with the other notes \cite{jevanjee} since the lapse rate $-dT/dz$ predicted is nearly the adiabatic lapse rate, but you need to account for the humid air and condensation.

Fit
===

Try to build an fit a bayesian structured time series model for the global mean temperature using as potential inputs, solar radiance, volcanic activity and carbon dioxide, and see the degree to which those three sources contribute and how much things are warming.
